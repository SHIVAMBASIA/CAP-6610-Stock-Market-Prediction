This Project was made for predicting Stock Market behavior by using LSTM,ARIMA and Prophet Models.
This Project was made for the CAP 6610 Machine Learning Course in University of Florida.

The three Jupyter Files are attached with namely LSTM_Stock_Price_Forecasting,Arima_Stock_Price_Forecasting,Prophet_Stock_Price_Forecasting which were implemented for LSTM,ARIMA and Prophet Model Forecasting respectively
The historical datasets are also attached with the zip file.

For rerunning all the code, just rerun the entire Jupyter notebook with uploading the datasets in Google Drive accordingly.
